# space_hackathon
This our repository for the Space Data Hackathon. The hackathon was divided into two tasks, Part 1 and Part2.

Part 1 in this challenge is to use the Swedish satellite data (e.g. Sentinel-2 â€” provided through ODC) to train a model that is able to estimate certain statistics for an occluded area based on the information from the surrounding area, as reliably and accurately as possible. 

Part 2 in this challenge is to develop a viable business case for the solution developed or from techniques utillsed to develop the solution. Team will be given a framework to follow for this aspect of the challenge.
